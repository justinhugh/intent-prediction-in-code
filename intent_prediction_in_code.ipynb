    "For this project, I conducted preliminary research in order to find alternatives or studies on the topic, and while some others have begun study on this problem, it seems that state of the art applications in the field can perform well in translating python code to pseudocode [[1]](#References). However at the moment there is no high-performing model, or model that can convert the code into an English description. This difficulty occurs because the structure and syntax of the two types of text (code and intent) are quite different from one another, whereas this difference is less pronounced between code and pseudocode. Being able to create pseudocode is a wonderful start to the problem, but is insufficient for my goal in making code more accessible. For many hobbyists or even professionals who do not program as their main function, pseudocode will not be a familiar or fully interprable format.\n",

This is especially clear when conducting an analysis of the distribution of the `prob` column. The average probability is very low, less than 10%, which indicates a very low amount of relation between the provided fields.  \n",

This is however not an exhaustive representation of how the mined data was used, as early modelling iterations included the mined data as well, but because of lengthy runtime and poor performance, these were abandoned. Additionally, including these cells would have constituted a great deal of redundancy in reporting on the process."

    "Tackling this problem required exploration into a wide variety of approaches in modelling. These approaches included a number of approaches in tokenization, modelling, and prediction techniques. \n",

    "\n",
    "For brevity and clarity of this report, below I will only outline the process for the most successful modelling approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, a large amount of work was done in assessing these other approaches in terms of vectorization and applied model, and thus I have included a supporting notebook file named `alternative_modelling_approaches.ipynb` which includes samples of the work done in investigating other approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective approach was found to be the use of a Seq2Seq model. Much of the style of implementation I will show below is influenced by a Seq2Seq article by Francois Chollet [[7]](#References).\n",

Tokenizing allows for numerical representation of text data, and breaks down a string into smaller components. \n",

On the other hand, specific to the data I am employing, there is quite frequent use of non-letter characters to convey an intent. Brackets `(,)` and quotation marks `\"` are commonly found in this field and should actually be quite useful as an output token. \n",

    "A Sequence-to-Sequence model (Seq2Seq) model is often applied when taking one input sequence and attempting to generate an output sequence [[8]](#References). This techenique implements a series fo Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, a \"stack\" of RNNs acts as the encoder. It processes the input data and at the tail end of the stack we recover a \"context vector\" which is the state at the final layer. The output data of this is discarded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the encoder, another \"stack\" of RNNs acts as the decoder. This is trained to take the context vector from the encoder, and use this as a starting point for predicting samples in the output sequence. The decoder is trying to predict the next token in the target sequence as if it were one \"time-step\" ahead of the current token in the target sequence. \n",

    "I've drafted a simplified representation of this technique to help visualize what is occurring.\n",

    "The first thing to consider in this case is that the accuracy results are not very meaningful or valuable. What we are trying to do here is to create predictive outputs which describe the input code document. This is a goal that an objective metric won't do a great job at. It seems more appropriate to consider the results subjectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand though, it is heartening that the loss and accuracy are both trending in the right direction, that is the loss appears to be steadily decreasing and the accuracy appears to be steadily increasing. Neither appears to have flattened out considerably yet. This indicates that given more time or more computing power, it's likely that more performance could be squeezed out of the model by training it further.\n"

    "## 9.2 - Model Qualitative Performance\n",
    "[[Back To TOC]](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessing the model results qualitatively is a very interesting exercise. Off the top, I will admit that the model is far from perfect, and certainly nowhere near productizeable in its current state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by discussing weaknesses of the model: \n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.2.1 - Model Weaknesses\n",
    "[[Back To TOC]](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways in which the performance is subjectively lacking, let's consider them for the purpose of academic discussion: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grammar** - The outputs the model creates are generally not structured in proper english. For the most part, when reading the predicted text verbatim, it does not constitute a grammatically correct sentence. There are examples of such things as double prepositions (\"in of\" for example) which is not how we speak English. This is understandable thought as I have not explicitly taught the model anything about grammatical structure. I suspect that expanding the amount of training data would help with this issue as grammar would be improved as a consequence of just seeing more samples. The model would begin understanding better where types of words belong in relation to one another. This wouldn't be perfect however, and it would be valuable to look into grammar-improving methods which have already been introduced by other data scientists.\n",
    "- **Stoppage** - The outputs often end quite late or prematurely. In predictions, there are many examples of the predicted text including multiple ideas before it predicts an end character. This is a problem because for the most part the snippets which are in the data set accomplish one task or idea, not often three unrelated ideas. This is a problem which requires deep thought to address. It's noteable that the prediction method which I've introduced into my model may actually be working in opposition to this. Consider the model being quite sure that the next token in a target sentence should be the end character. If the prediction method was a hard prediction, it would simply end the sentence. However, with my random choice method, it is still very much possible another token will be selected based on the soft choice.\n",
    "- **Limited Vocabulary** - There are only ~2500 target tokens, and this can become quite evident if many outputs are predicted with the demo function. Some tokens like \"'\", and \"of\" appear very commonly and frequently in the output string. This is certainly partially due to the restricted data size that the model was trained on, but warrants a deeper investigation into the proportionality of tokens in the corpus. If there is an imbalance here, a bias may be introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.2.2 - Model Strengths\n",
    "[[Back To TOC]](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that there are a number of ways in which the model falls short of achieveing the set goal, but there are also a lot of incredibly interesting observations we can make about how the model is performing, and what it is doing well. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the outputs of the model have an element of randomness, I've included a screenshot of one particular output of the `demo()` function for the sake of discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screen Shot 2020-12-19 at 7.46.13 PM.png](attachment:72ef7da5-eaf4-49e0-8eeb-643cdd40c02a.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Structural Patterns** - Looking at the second example's predicted test we can see a very strong indication that the model associates a quotation mark with itself. This is fantastic! The way that we use quotation marks in code is in fact strongly related with itself. A quotation mark is used to open a statement (often a string) and it must be used again in order to end that statement (or string). In the second decoded sentence, each of the quotation marks is paired with another, and in the first case, the quotation marks even contain a single character as such: 'l'. This something we can reasonably expect to see in real code! Any code that is referring to the letter 'l' would include this pattern. \n",
    "- **Related Terms** - On a similar note to the last point, there are multiple examples of patterns occurring where words that are related appear together.Consider the first decoded output. In this first output there are short phrases of very significant ideas such as \"get the possible dataframe\" and \"contains a module\". These express interesting and rather complicated ideas with actual meaning. Though they may have been generated randomly, the model has successfully placed these tokens together because it has picked up on the relation between these terms i.e. they can be found in close proximity frequently, and it's meaningful when they are. \n",
    "- **Token Variety** - Although the token vocabulary is small, there is a lot of variation in the output strings being generated. That is to say that we are not seeing exactly the same thing or same collection of tokens predicted each time. This may indicate that although the model might not have the perfect vocabulary to express what is contained in the input sequence, it is successfully identifying the input sequences as different from one another, and generating a variety of different context vectors as inputs to the decoder as a result."

    "[[Back To TOC]](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project although submission ready, is far from complete in my eyes. There are many opportunities to continue iterating and improving on the what I've accomplished thus far. Some examples are included below: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Expand the Training Data Set** - I've mentioned multiple times in the report that one of the deficiencies of this approach is the very restricted size of the data set. This was an appropriate approach for this capstone submission but in order to gain improvements on the model's performance, it has become clear that the data set is not large enough. I plan to continue conducting research looking for other annotated code data sets which can be used to also train this model. These may be difficult to find since the one I am working with is manually annotated and it's unlikely there are many others like it. I also plan to consider mined data, or mine my own data. Either of these approaches would need additional effort to clean data, or assess its potency. If the training data set were significantly expanded, I would expect to see improvements in the model's token vocabulary, loss, accuracy, and prediction quality (subjectively). \n",
    "- **Continue Tuning the Seq2Seq Model** - The Seq2Seq model presented in this report is both basic, and largely un-tuned. A key step in improving the performance of a model which is based on a neural network is to investigate the effects of tuning its hyperparameters. I plan to continue iterating on the model created by determining the effect of introducting additional layers in the network architecture, trying other optimizers and metrics, varying the dropout in each layer, and so on. There is a wealth of \"knobs to turn\" which could improve the results. These things however take time and resources to explore and so they are identified as a next step for now.\n",
    "- **Iterate on Business Case** - I have conducted preliminary research in the problem space, but as with any valuable business case, there's more to learn about how valuable a model this might be. I plan to take steps in order to confirm the hypothesis that a model which can predict code's intent is valuable to people other than those included in my preliminary research. In order to accomplish this, I would like to create a web application implementation of the model, and allow others to make predictions of their own, or view my commentary on the model. \n",

    "This capstone project has been an incredible learning experience, requiring me to conduct a lot of self-directed research and experimentation. I feel having this experience under my belt, I take many lessons-learned with me in planning how to approach other data science problems in the future not only in the NLP space, but in any problem that requires modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "In particular I noted that there were a few themes which presented themselves repeatedly in the process: \n",
    "- **Agile Process** - This is the first theme that comes to mind. At the start of this process I felt quickly paralyzed by the size of the problem, and if I were to plan stepwise how to accomplish the desired result by the end of the timeframe, I would not have been able to. By quickly embracing an agile approach to the problem, I was able to very rapidly attempt a number of varied approaches, learning from each in turn more about the problem space. Through this iterative approach I was able to break up the problem into smaller and more attainable pieces, and finishing with a satisfying result.\n",
    "- **Tokenization** - Tokenization had to be considered over and over again. This makes sense because the tokens are the smallest unit which we use to train NLP models, and in this case with which we predict an output sequence. Between attempting character-to-character sequences, and considering how to handle special characters, there are many modifications which can be made to the data with regards to tokenization, all which affect the model results.\n",
    "- **Seq2Seq** - This is a very deep subject, and I feel as if in this project I've just scraped the surface of using Seq2Seq models. With the broad customization avaiable when building these models, I believe there is a lot more to learn about how to optimally apply these and espcially so in this problem space.\n",

    "There is a lot more iteration and improvement opportunity available to me on this problem, but with this project I believe I've built a solid foundation for continuing to see those opportunities through."
