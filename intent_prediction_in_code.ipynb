Yet, only a fraction of us are literate in code, and even among those of us who are, there are a wide range of languages and frameworks so no one is familiar with it all, and mistakes or misinterpretations can be made even on languages we're familiar with. \n",

    "For this project, I conducted preliminary research in order to find alternatives or studies on the topic, and while some others have begun study on this problem, it seems that state of the art applications in the field can perform well in translating python code to pseudocode [[1]](#References). However at the moment there is no high-performing model, or model that can convert the code into an English description. This difficulty occurs because the structure and syntax of the two types of text (code and intent) are quite different from one another, whereas this difference is less pronounced between code and pseudocode. Being able to create pseudocode is a wonderful start to the problem, but is insufficient for my goal in making code more accessible. For many hobbyists or even professionals who do not program as their main function, pseudocode will not be a familiar or fully interprable format.\n",

    "Early in this project, I conducted lengthy EDA on the \"Mined Data\" which was provided in the CoNaLa Competition. After progressing with this, and developing a method to clean and combining this data with the CoNaLa training data, I conducted modelling with this combined set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, in these preliminary modelling activities, I gained some lessons learned which indicated that continuing to include the mined data would be suboptimal for the purposes of this study. These include the following: \n",
    "- The mined data set is far larger than both the training and test data sets. Its influence on the modelling and conclusions would represent a significant imbalance without extensive efforts to balance the data.\n",
    "- The mined data set communicates its data in a very different manner compared to the training and test sets\n",
    "    - The mined data set does not have a `rewritten intent` field to compare with that of the training and test sets.\n",
    "    - The mined data set includes a `prob` feature which indicates the chance that the response code snippet is in fact related to the Stack Overflow Query. \n",
    "- The quality of the data has not been reviewed by volunteers and so cannot be trusted with the same confidence of the others. This is especially clear when conducting an analysis of the distribution of the `prob` column. The average probability is very low, less than 10%, which indicates a very low amount of relation between the provided fields.  \n",
    "- With the computing resources and the strict timelines in which I'd been working in, timeliness of modelling is a major consideration. Because of this it's important to restrict the data set to only the necessary elements.\n",
