    "For this project, I conducted preliminary research in order to find alternatives or studies on the topic, and while some others have begun study on this problem, it seems that state of the art applications in the field can perform well in translating python code to pseudocode [[1]](#References). However at the moment there is no high-performing model, or model that can convert the code into an English description. This difficulty occurs because the structure and syntax of the two types of text (code and intent) are quite different from one another, whereas this difference is less pronounced between code and pseudocode. Being able to create pseudocode is a wonderful start to the problem, but is insufficient for my goal in making code more accessible. For many hobbyists or even professionals who do not program as their main function, pseudocode will not be a familiar or fully interprable format.\n",

This is especially clear when conducting an analysis of the distribution of the `prob` column. The average probability is very low, less than 10%, which indicates a very low amount of relation between the provided fields.  \n",

    "I've provided a supplemental file in my submission titled `conala_mined_data` which presents a sample of work done in loading and exploring the mined data a bit. This is however not an exhaustive representation of how the mined data was used, as early modelling iterations included the mined data as well, but because of lengthy runtime and poor performance, these were abandoned. Additionally, including these cells would have constituted a great deal of redundancy in reporting on the process."

    "Tackling this problem required exploration into a wide variety of approaches in modelling. These approaches included a number of approaches in tokenization, modelling, and prediction techniques. \n",

    "\n",
    "For brevity and clarity of this report, below I will only outline the process for the most successful modelling approach. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, a large amount of work was done in assessing these other approaches in terms of vectorization and applied model, and thus I have included a supporting notebook file named `alternative_modelling_approaches.ipynb` which includes samples of the work done in investigating other approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective approach was found to be the use of a Seq2Seq model. Much of the style of implementation I will show below is influenced by a Seq2Seq article by Francois Chollet [[7]](#References).\n",

Tokenizing allows for numerical representation of text data, and breaks down a string into smaller components. \n",

On the other hand, specific to the data I am employing, there is quite frequent use of non-letter characters to convey an intent. Brackets `(,)` and quotation marks `\"` are commonly found in this field and should actually be quite useful as an output token. \n",

    "A Sequence-to-Sequence model (Seq2Seq) model is often applied when taking one input sequence and attempting to generate an output sequence [[8]](#References). This techenique implements a series fo Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). \n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, a \"stack\" of RNNs acts as the encoder. It processes the input data and at the tail end of the stack we recover a \"context vector\" which is the state at the final layer. The output data of this is discarded. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following the encoder, another \"stack\" of RNNs acts as the decoder. This is trained to take the context vector from the encoder, and use this as a starting point for predicting samples in the output sequence. The decoder is trying to predict the next token in the target sequence as if it were one \"time-step\" ahead of the current token in the target sequence. \n",

    "I've drafted a simplified representation of this technique to help visualize what is occurring.\n",
